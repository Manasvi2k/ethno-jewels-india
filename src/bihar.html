     Bihar's jewelry tradition encompasses both tribal artistry using natural materials and refined metalwork, including the delicate Paunchi and the ornamental Tikuli. Bridal jewelry holds special significance, featuring unique pieces like the Mauri and Lahthi bangles, symbolizing marital status and prosperity.

  <p>
     The creation of "Paunchi" bracelets involves the meticulous stringing together of numerous small silver or brass replicas of jasmine buds, often requiring skilled hands to ensure the delicate and fragrant-inspired design is maintained. The "Tikuli" art form, where ornamental work is done on fine glass with wafer-thin gold or silver leaves, is a specialized craft passed down through generations of artisans. Thin sheets of glass are carefully shaped and then adorned with intricate patterns using extremely fine metallic leaves, requiring immense precision and patience. "Lahthi" bangles, made of lac (a natural resin), are crafted by heating and molding the lac into circular shapes, often then brightly colored and sometimes embellished with mirrors or beads, and are a significant symbol of marriage.

    <strong>Did you know?</strong>The "Chuda" is a traditional bangle set worn by brides in Bihar, symbolizing their marital status. It is typically made of red and white bangles, representing prosperity and purity, and is often gifted by the maternal uncle of the bride during the wedding ceremony.

  <p>
    Bridal jewelry in Bihar includes the "Mauri," traditionally made from mango or date leaves (now often replaced by decorative paper and mirrors), which is carefully constructed to adorn the groom's head, symbolizing blessings and prosperity. The "Tikli," worn along the central parting of the bride's hair, is often an intricate piece featuring gemstones or enamel work set in gold or silver, enhancing her bridal look. The "Dholna," an ornate wedding necklace with a drum-shaped gold locket, is a significant heirloom piece, often featuring detailed engravings or enamel work. "Bichhua," or toe rings, traditionally made of silver, are another essential symbol of matrimony for women in Bihar.
