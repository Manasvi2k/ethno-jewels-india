        JEWELLERY OF JHARKHAND

    <p>
        The tribal jewelry of Jharkhand is typically handcrafted using simple tools and traditional methods. Ornaments made from natural materials like seeds, beads, wood, and animal bones are created by stringing, carving, and shaping these elements into necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and other adornments. Bell-metal and brass jewelry is produced using techniques like casting, where molten metal is poured into molds, and hammering, where the metal is shaped by repeated blows. The designs often feature geometric patterns and motifs that are specific to each tribal community and hold cultural and symbolic meaning.
