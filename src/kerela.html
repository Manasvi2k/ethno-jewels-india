  <p>
     The crafting of Kerala's renowned gold jewelry emphasizes purity and intricate detailing. "Kasu Mala" necklaces are made by carefully linking numerous small gold coins, often bearing the image of a deity or traditional motifs. The weight and number of coins signify the value and status of the ornament. "Palakka Mala" necklaces feature leaf-shaped emeralds set in gold, requiring skilled setting to showcase the natural beauty of the stones. "Mulla Mottu Mala" necklaces, resembling strings of jasmine buds, are created by meticulously shaping and joining small gold segments to mimic the delicate form of the flowers.
