        JEWELLERY OF ARUNACHAL PRADESH
      </h1>

  <p>
    The jewelry of Arunachal Pradesh is deeply rooted in nature, with tribal communities crafting unique ornaments from materials like beads, shells, and metals. Each tribe, such as the Adi and Mishmi, has distinct styles and significant pieces that reflect their cultural identity and social status.

  <p>
    The creation of jewelry in Arunachal Pradesh is deeply intertwined with the natural resources available and the traditional skills passed down within each tribe. For the Adi tribe's "ashier" shell necklaces, specific types of shells are carefully selected, cleaned, and often polished before being strung together in intricate patterns. The process can be time-consuming, and the resulting necklaces are not only decorative but also hold significant cultural and spiritual value, often worn during important ceremonies and social gatherings. The Mishmi tribe's silver jewelry requires metalworking skills, with artisans melting and shaping silver into sheets and wires to create the characteristic chest straps and headbands. Silver coins, often antique or specially minted, are meticulously attached to the straps, signifying wealth and prestige. The large, dumbbell-shaped "krupei" earplugs are crafted from silver and require specialized techniques to achieve their distinctive form, often being gradually enlarged over time.

    <strong>Did you know?</strong> The jewelry of Arunachal Pradesh is not just ornamental; it often serves as a form of currency and a symbol of social status within the tribes.

  <p>
    The use of other natural materials like bamboo, cane, reeds, animal bones, ivory (where permitted historically), feathers, and wild flowers in Arunachal's jewelry reflects a deep connection to the environment. Beads made from seeds are often painstakingly drilled and strung together to create colorful necklaces and bracelets. Ornaments made from animal bones or ivory are often carved with symbolic motifs reflecting the tribe's beliefs and history. The vibrant colors and unique textures of these natural materials contribute to the distinctive aesthetic of Arunachal's tribal jewelry, each piece telling a story of the land and its people.
